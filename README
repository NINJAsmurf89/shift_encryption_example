This is a quick program that allows for the simple shift encryption on a given
input file. 

All files must be in the working directory in order for the code to recognize them

The program will make files called "encrypt.txt" and "decrypt.txt" and the former
is needed for the decrypt function to run properly. Once you have generated an
"encrypt.txt" you can send it to someone else that is using this codebase and they
can then decrypt it with no hastle.

The text files provided are examples and the code will not reognise them as usable
files. You can create the "example_encrypt/decrypt.txt files by running the code
with "example_input.txt"

Best of luck and have fun with this!
